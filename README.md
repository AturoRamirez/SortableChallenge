# SortableChallenge

This is my answer to the sortable challenge

To run the project it is necessary to use the ./run command, there is the option to send new test files, otherwise if no parameter is sent it will take default files from challenge, it is important to mention that the first argument will always be taken as the product file and the second as the listing file.

Finally as a result it generates two outputs Result.text file and terminal printing

examples

./run

./run products.txt

./run products.txt listing.txt
